#To use this in your existing code, you would replace the face_recognition.face_distance() call with our custom implementation. Here's how to modify the relevant section of your code:

# Replace this line:
# faceDis = face_recognition.face_distance(encoded_face_train, encodeFace)

# With these lines:
faceDis = calculate_euclidean_distance(encoded_face_train, encodeFace)
matchIndex = np.argmin(faceDis)

#The manual implementation:
#1. Takes a list of known encodings and a single face encoding to compare against
#2. Converts inputs to numpy arrays for efficient computation
#3. Calculates the Euclidean distance using the formula: sqrt(sum((x1-x2)Â²))
#4. Returns an array of distances between the input face encoding and each known encoding

#Key features of this implementation:
#- Uses numpy for efficient vector operations
#- Handles both single and batch comparisons
#- Includes shape validation and error handling
#- Provides a companion compare_faces function that mimics the original library's behavior

# The distance calculation follows these steps:
# 1. Subtract each known encoding from the target encoding
# 2. Square the differences
# 3. Sum the squared differences along the feature dimension
# 4. Take the square root to get the final Euclidean distance
